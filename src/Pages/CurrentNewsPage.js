        <h3>Hurricanes Arriving Earlier Due to Climate Change</h3>
        <p>New research has revealed that since the 1980s, Category 4 and 5 hurricanes (maximum wind speed greater than 131 miles per hour) have been arriving three to four days earlier with each passing decade of climate change.

The study, published in the journal Nature, was conducted by researchers at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. The researchers used satellite data and historical cyclone tracks to analyze the arrival dates of intense hurricanes from 1981 to 2020.

They found that Category 4 and 5 hurricanes have been arriving an average of 1.5 days earlier per decade since the 1980s. This trend is expected to continue in the future, as climate change is causing sea surface temperatures to rise.

Warmer sea surface temperatures provide more energy for hurricanes to form and intensify. This means that hurricanes are becoming more powerful and are lasting longer.

The earlier arrival of intense hurricanes is a major concern for coastal communities. With less time to prepare, communities are more vulnerable to the devastating impacts of these storms.

"When intense tropical cyclones occur earlier than usual, they cause unexpected problems for communities," said Pao-Shin Chu, atmospheric sciences professor at the University of Hawaii at Manoa and lead author of the study.

"Moreover, the earlier advance of these storms will overlap with other weather systems, for example local thunderstorms or seasonal monsoon rainfall, and can produce compounding extreme events and strain the emergency response."

The study's findings highlight the importance of climate change adaptation for coastal communities. Communities need to develop plans to prepare for the earlier arrival of intense hurricanes and other climate-related hazards.`,</p>
